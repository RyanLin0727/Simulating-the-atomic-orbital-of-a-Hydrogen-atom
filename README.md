# Simulating-the-atomic-orbital-of-a-Hydrogen-atom
The user just have to enter the quantum numbers (n, l, m), then the program will automatically generate the electron probability-density distributions (both for 2D and 3D graphs); 

By using this program, we don't have to solve the complex differential equations and try to plot the graph based on the calculation.
